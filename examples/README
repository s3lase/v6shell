Welcome to osh rc files!

The Sixth Edition Thompson shell did not read/execute rc (init and
logout) files.  The fact that osh does so is simply one of its
enhancements.  This makes osh a much better login shell than it
might be otherwise, as the ability to execute rc files can make
things much easier for the user.  An rc file is simply a regular
shell script, aka command file, that the shell treats specially.

This collection of osh(1) rc files may be studied as is, used as
templates, modified, and/or installed for personal or general use.

For full details about how osh handles rc files, please refer to
the "Startup and shutdown" subsection of osh(1) manual page @
http://v6shell.org/man/osh.1.html#StartupAndShutdown .

-------
INSTALL:
1) Run FILEPREP script to prepare rc files for installation.

	usage: osh FILEPREP /path/to/nonexistent_directory

2) cd or chdir to specified directory.

3) Modify *osh* files to taste (e.g., change PATH, etc).

4) Copy *osh* files to destinations noted in fileprep.log .

...
Depending on system configuration, you may need to become superuser
in order to successfully install system-wide rc files.

-------
I install and use variations of these files on several different
systems.  This includes GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and
OpenSolaris.  On GNU/Linux systems, you may wish to refer to the
manual pages for the utilities invoked in these files as there might
be incompatibilities that I have not encountered.  For example,
this is true for stty(1).

If you have any comments or questions about this software, I encourage
you to contact me via email.  Thanks & Enjoy!
