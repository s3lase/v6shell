Changes that improve compatibility w/ the Sixth Edition Unix shell
are marked w/ a `C:' in the details below.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[osh-20070131]:
osh.1:
	* Made a few minimal changes to synchronize the manual w/ the code.

osh.c	1.2 (jneitzel) 2007/01/14:
	* Changed the `chdir: No old directory' diagnostic to
	  `chdir: No previous directory' to match the manual.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[osh-20061230]:
	The following files have been removed in this release:
		examples/*: These files are now available at:
			    http://jneitzel.sdf1.org/osh/initialization_files/
		   tests/*: ... until I have a chance to rewrite them ...

*.1:
	* Changed all instances of `UNIX' to `Unix' since the name
	  of the Unix operating system is not an acronym.

pexec.c:
	* Fixed a possible, but very unlikely, memory leak.

osh.c:
	C: Rewrote the shell!  It is now a combination of the ports of the
	   original source code from sh6.c and glob6.c (see CHANGES_sh-to-sh6)
	   w/ the prior enhancements which were found in osh-060124/osh*.[ch] .

fd2.c:
	* Removed the call to lseek(2) to end-of-file for errors.
	  The shell determines when this is necessary.

	* Changed the `: no shell' diagnostic to `: No shell!'
	  in the spirit of sh6(1).

goto.c:
	* Fixed a bug which interfered w/ finding a requested label when
	  its first character had the high-order bit set.  The value of the
	  first character is now passed to getlabel() as an unsigned char
	  converted to an int to allow correct comparison in such a case.

if.c:
	* Removed the call to lseek(2) to end-of-file for errors.
	  The shell determines when this is necessary.

	* Changed the method used to build the argument list for all commands
	  executed by this utility, and removed the `Too many args' diagnostic.
	  The maximum length of the argument list for a command is now limited
	  only by the maximum length that the invoker can pass and by any
	  system-imposed limit for execve(2) (see E2BIG in errno(2)).

	* Changed the `: no shell' diagnostic to `: No shell!'
	  in the spirit of sh6(1).

	* Changed the diagnostic used for `!', `-a', `-o', and `(' operator
	  errors from `: argument expected' to `: expression expected'.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[osh-060124]:
Makefile:
	* Added targets for building/installing sh6(1) and glob6(1).
	  Refer to the README file for further details.

	* Removed the `check-sh6' target since the tests were originally
	  written for osh(1) and sh6(1) as Thompson-shell reimplementations,
	  not ports.

sh6:
	* Changed sh6(1) from being a reimplementation which is compiled from
	  the same sources as osh(1) to being a port of the original Thompson
	  shell from Sixth Edition Unix.  Refer to the CHANGES_sh-to-sh6 file
	  for further details.

osh:
	C: Treat both `( ; )' and `( & )' as syntax errors.

	C: Print the process ID for each command of an asynchronous pipeline,
	   not just the last command.

	C: Added the `newgrp' special command.  It is similar to `login'
	   except that the newgrp(1) utility replaces the current interactive
	   shell rather than the login(1) utility.

	* When opening `/dev/null' is needed for an asynchronous command,
	  call open(2) w/ the O_RDONLY flag instead of O_RDWR.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[osh-051120]:
	This release fixes some problems introduced in osh-051030.

[fios]*.1:
	* Made a few minimal changes for the sake of clarity.

osh and sh6:
	* Fixed a file (pipe) descriptor leak in pipeline execution when
	  the shell is interactive.  This also includes those cases where
	  the shell is executing an initialization file or sourcing a file
	  from an interactive shell.  Specifically, when the shell detected
	  an error during execution of a pipeline, it did not close(2) all
	  of the appropriate pipe descriptors which had been allocated by
	  pipe(2) for the next command in the pipeline.

	* Reverted the unconventional execution error behavior introduced
	  in the previous release since this change was out of character
	  w/ the Thompson shell, and other common Unix shells as well.

osh only:
	* Fixed a bug in the `exec' special command where a pipeline such as
	  `( cat /dev/zero ) | exec sleep 1' would not replace the current
	  shell with an instance of sleep(1).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[osh-051030]:
	This release includes the following new files:
		  fd2.[1c]: This is the fd2 utility from fd2-050215.
		pexec.[ch]: The pexec() function is used instead of execvp(3).
			    See below for details.

LICENSE:
	* Added an entry for pexec.c which mentions its being derived from
	  the NetBSD project's /usr/src/lib/libc/gen/execvp.c and includes
	  a copy of its original license.  Of course, the pexec.c file also
	  includes the pertinent license information.

Makefile:
	* Added appropriate targets for building/installing the fd2 utility.
	  The default is to build/install osh, if, goto, and fd2.

examples:
	* Updated the example initialization files and command files.

tests:
	* Made changes to the tests in accordance w/ changes to the software.

*.1:
	* Made revisions in accordance w/ changes to the software.

osh and sh6:
	* Did some more generic code cleanup and simplification.
	  This was largely inspired by the fact that the developer was
	  seeking workarounds for a few system bugs present in Mac OS X
	  (Panther and Tiger).  The system and library calls with some
	  incorrect behavior include:
		lseek(2)             - Panther only,
		fstat(2) and glob(3) - Tiger only.

	  Since the bugs present in Panther differ from those in Tiger, the
	  workarounds were removed for the sake of simplicity.  However, the
	  generic code cleanups remain.  The observed problems for the shell
	  in Mac OS X are very minor and do not interfere w/ using the shell
	  in the normal case.  The results from `make check' demonstrate the
	  exceptional cases where Mac OS X impedes operation of the shell.

	* If the shell is invoked w/ an invalid argument list (argc == 0),
	  exit w/ error and print the diagnostic `Invalid argument list'.

	* After the shell is invoked and initializes itself but before it
	  begins reading/executing commands, close any open descriptors in
	  the range 3 - 19 (inclusive) that the shell did not set up for
	  itself.  Note that doing so does not break x-only scripts if
	  such scripts are supported on a particular Unix system.

	* Increased some key buffer sizes...
	  The size of the command-line buffer now allows for 2047 characters
	  in each command line instead of 1023.  The size of the argument list
	  array now allows for 511 arguments in each command instead of 255.

	* Set the SIGCHLD signal to its default action when the shell starts.
	  This is necessary on some systems because the shell's parent process
	  might try to ignore SIGCHLD, and correct operation of the shell
	  requires that zombies be created for its terminated children.
	  Otherwise, the shell may not be able to properly waitpid(2)
	  for, and report the termination status of, its children
	  when they terminate.

	* The asynchronous and sequential process lists are no longer
	  dynamically allocated.  Now, these process lists are statically
	  allocated, each allowing up to 64 process IDs.  This is more than
	  adequate in the normal case.  Also, it has the benefit of a simpler
	  implementation.  A diagnostic is printed if the limits are exceeded.

	* The shell no longer uses execvp(3).  Instead, it uses pexec() which
	  is simply a derivation of NetBSD's execvp(3).  This change allows the
	  shell to deal with ENOEXEC errors in a way which is to similar to how
	  the Thompson shell handled it.  In addition, it allows the user to
	  disable the searching of PATH for external commands.  This is done
	  by unsetting PATH or setting it to the empty string.

	* Instead of exiting with a status of 1 for some errors and a status
	  of 2 for others, simply use a status of 2 to indicate that the shell
	  has detected an error.  See the `EXIT STATUS' section of the shell
	  manual pages for the final word on the exit status of the shell.

	* Fixed a problem in how the shell exits on error when invoked w/
	  the `-c' option.  The problem can be observed in ssh(1) by doing
	  a `ssh user@host "syntax error >"' which requires the user to type
	  an EOT (^D) (assuming input is a terminal) in order to cause the
	  shell to exit.  Now, the shell exits as it should.

	* A cleanup of the logic and code for shell termination on errors
	  was also done.  This is related to the problem mentioned above.
	  Now, for the `-c' and `-t' options the shell does not affect the
	  offset of the standard input when an error occurs.  That is, it
	  no longer calls lseek(2), simply calling exit(3) in such cases.

	* The shell now aborts execution of a command line when it detects
	  an execution error that happens before calling fork(2).  This can
	  help in an interactive shell in particular.  For example:
	  1)
		% wc -l data
		      66 data
		% chdir bad_dir; ( : ) >data
		chdir: bad directory
		% wc -l data
		       0 data

	  2)
		% wc -l data
		      66 data
		% chdir bad_dir; ( : ) >data
		chdir: bad directory
		% wc -l data
		      66 data

	  In the first case, this obviously clobbers the file `data' which
	  might be very undesirable if `data' is important.  In the second
	  case however, `data' is never clobbered since the failed `chdir'
	  aborts execution of the command line.

	* If command-line overflow occurs on a terminal device, the shell
	  no longer uses tcflush(3) to discard the overflowed characters.
	  Instead, it simply reads and discards the remaining overflowed
	  characters which have been received from the terminal for the
	  overflowed line.

	* Changed when the shell generates termination reports for
	  asynchronous processes.  Instead of being generated after
	  a command line is read and parsed, but before it is executed...
	  They are now generated after a command line is executed.
	  This prevents the possibility that the user might miss an
	  important process termination if it is reported just before
	  a screen-oriented text editor (like vi(1)) is invoked.
	  Now, the process termination will be reported after the
	  user quits the editor.

osh only:
	* Eliminated all of the code for the run-time compatibility toggles.
	  Trying to have 2 shells in one is simply not worth the increase in
	  code size and complexity.  If the user wants compatible only, the
	  simple solution is to compile and run the shell as sh6(1).
	  Otherwise, compile and run it as osh(1).

	* Eliminated the globbing behavior for failed matches which was like
	  that found in the Bourne shell.  Osh(1) now uses only the behavior
	  found in the Thompson shell for failed matches.  See the manual page
	  for details, but in short the user may see a `No match' diagnostic.

	* Changed the effect of command-line overflow when it occurs in an
	  initialization file.  Previously, the shell would treat it as an
	  error and lseek(2) to the end of the file.  Now, the shell shall
	  continue to read and execute commands from the file as if no error
	  had occurred.  Though, the `Command line overflow' diagnostic is
	  still printed, and the exit status is set accordingly.

	* Added 2 new environment variables and 2 new special parameters.
	  OSHDIR corresponds w/ `$d', and EXECSHELL corresponds w/ `$e'.
	  See the osh(1) manual page for full details.

	* Made the shell to be more picky about correct usage for the
	  `setenv', `unsetenv', and `umask' special commands.

	* The `source' special command can now substitute
	  positional parameters.

goto:
	* Reduced LABELSIZE from 1024 to 64.  This allows a maximum label
	  length of 63 characters, which is more than adequate.  Assuming the
	  user limits each possible label character to be one of [0-9A-Za-z],
	  a label length limit of 63 characters still allows 8.33060e+112
	  possible unique labels.

	* Changed the way `label too long' is handled.  Rather than giving a
	  `label too long' error if a possible label found in a command file
	  is too long, simply give this error when the user-requested label
	  is longer than 63 characters.  In such a case, no label search
	  shall be performed at all.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[osh-050219]:
examples:
	* Updated the example initialization files.

	* Added a few command files to give users a head start
	  in scripting the shell.

osh.1 and sh6.1:
	* Made a few more minimal revisions.

osh and sh6:
	* Did some more code cleanup.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[osh-050131]:
*.1:
	* Made some revisions and added some new content.

osh and sh6:
	* Did some code cleanup for the sake of clarity and simplicity.
	  Basically, this just removes some redundant operations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[osh-041231]:
LICENSE:
	* Removed clauses 3 and 4 from the license under which I release
	  this software.  This only affects my license.  Do not worry;
	  this software is still free!  Read LICENSE for further info.
	  Each file on which I explicitly claim copyright also contains
	  a copy of this license.

tests:
	* Added 2 more tests to be run by `make check' and `make check-sh6'.

	* Did some reorganization as well.

osh and sh6:
	* Fixed a typo in the execute() function that can cause a memory fault
	  in sh6, and in osh when running in compatible mode.  This error was
	  only possible when using the `chdir' special command preceded by a
	  redirection such as `> file' (e.g., `> /dev/null chdir foo').

	* Made several changes to how the shell reads input into the
	  command-line buffer.  Generally, this is not a user-visible
	  change but is noteworthy nonetheless.

	* Made a few improvements to the parser.
	  It now catches a few errors that could have previously caused some
	  confusion.  Before: `echo \<<', `echo \>>', `echo foo>bar', etc...
	  None of these would have been considered a syntax error.  Now, all
	  of them are.  The unquoted `<' and `>' characters in the above
	  commands are not considered to be redirection arguments.

	  In this implementation of the shell, a redirection argument must be
	  separated from other command-line arguments by one or more blanks.
	  This is unlike other shells.  However, since this is the documented
	  behavior of the Thompson shell, this implementation of the shell
	  adheres to the documented behavior for the sake of simplicity.

	* Fixed incorrect globbing results for quoted glob characters.
	  Now, the shell correctly handles quoted glob characters in an
	  argument when the same argument also contains *unquoted* glob
	  characters.  Note that the correct behavior of globbing in
	  the shell relies on a POSIX-compliant glob(3) being available
	  on the system where the shell is built and/or used.

osh only:
	* Fixed a small problem with the `source' special command.
	  Doing a `source /path/to/nonexistent_file' in an initialization file
	  should not cause the shell to cease execution of that file.  Now,
	  execution of the initialization file continues as normal.  Of course,
	  user can test for error and have the shell act accordingly in such
	  a case.

	* Renamed the `trap' special command to `sigign' since it is really
	  nothing like the trap command found in other shells.  Thus, I thought
	  calling it `trap' could be misleading to the user.  On the other hand,
	  `sigign' makes sense given what the command does, which is to ignore
	  or unignore signals.

if:
	* Did another rewrite of the if(1) utility.
	  Started with a fresh copy of if.c from Sixth Edition Unix.
	  User-visible changes?  None.

goto:
	* Did another rewrite of the goto(1) utility.
	  Started with a fresh copy of goto.c from Sixth Edition Unix.
	  User-visible changes?  Yes, it is no longer an error for a NUL
	  character to appear in the input.  Also, it now prints an explicit
	  `cannot seek' diagnostic if the input file is not seekable.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[osh-041028]:
*.1:
	* Fixed a few typos in osh.1 and sh6.1.

	* Did a little fine tuning of osh.1 and sh6.1 to hopefully
	  eliminate some incomplete and/or unclear explanations.

	* Did the same for both if.1 and goto.1.

osh and sh6:
	* Fixed an annoying bug introduced in the previous release...
	  The way error messages were printed in error() was not accounting
	  for the fact that the standard error stream is quite often (if not
	  always) unbuffered by default.  This could make some error messages
	  difficult to read when a pipeline was involved.  A little example:
	  Before (unfixed):
		% foo|bar|baz
		foo: not foundbar: not foundbaz: not found


	  After (fixed):
		% foo|bar|baz
		foo: not found
		bar: not found
		baz: not found

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[osh-041018]:
	This release includes sh6 in addition to osh, if, and goto.
	Sh6 is simply osh without the enhancements.  It is built from the
	same sources as osh, but it is not built or installed by default.

Makefile:
	* Added targets for sh6 so that it can optionally be built, tested,
	  and installed if desired.

osh and sh6:
	* Split the code into modules.
	  This is primarily for developer sanity... ;)
	  The new files are osh.h, main.c, parse.c, and exec.c.

	* If (geteuid() != getuid() || getegid() != getgid()) is true,
	  print a nice error message and exit with a status of 2.

	* Strip all NUL characters from the shell's standard input as it is
	  being read into the command line buffer.  Input to the shell is
	  expected to be text.

	* Changed the way the shell handles non-seekable files.
	  This is for both initialization files (osh only) and command files.
	  Do not block on open(2); open it and determine if it is a regular
	  file (or seekable).  If it is not a regular file or is not seekable,
	  exit with an error.  If seekable, reset the file for blocking I/O
	  and continue as normal.

	  Note that you can still read commands from FIFOs if you want.
	  Instead of doing `osh myfifo', you can either do `osh <myfifo'
	  or `osh - my list of positional parameters <myfifo'.

	* Changed the error handling to use stdarg(3).
	  This allows for more code consistency and makes it easier
	  to handle all errors with just one line of code.

osh only:
	* Added another possible initialization file for osh: $HOME/.oshrc
	  Osh only attempts to execute commands from this file if it is an
	  interactive shell.  In the case of a login shell, osh tries this
	  file only after it tries both /etc/osh.login and $HOME/.osh.login.

	* Made osh less strict about errors in initialization files.
	  Previously, common shell-detected errors in any of the files
	  were generally treated in the same way as they would have been
	  treated in a command file (i.e., the error was fatal).  Realizing
	  that this potentially caused difficulty and annoyance for the user,
	  I opted to change it so that these types of errors are handled as
	  they are when osh is interactive.

	  This should make it easier for the user to debug
	  initialization files if needed.

	* Added a `source' special command.
	  It is functionally similar to the way this command works in csh(1).
	  See osh(1) for details.

if:
	* Changed ARGMAX from 50 to 256.

	* If (geteuid() != getuid() || getegid() != getgid()) is true,
	  print a nice error message and exit with a status of 2.

	* Added a few new primaries: `-h', `-s', `-t', and `-x'
	  See if(1) for details.

goto:
	* Changed the size of the label buffer from 128 to 1024.

	* Do not require the `:' of a labelled line to appear in column 1.
	  Instead, allow the `:' to optionally be preceded by blanks so that
	  labelled lines can be indented in command files.  See goto(1) for
	  more details if needed.

	* Eliminated unnecessary calls to strcmp(3) whenever a possible label
	  cannot possibly match the label argument given on the command line.

	* Give an error if any NUL character is encountered in the input.

	* Give an error if a zero-length string is given as the label argument.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[osh-040812]:
osh.c:
	* Changed the way unused pipe descriptors are handled in the child
	  process after fork().  This fixes a bug where the pipe in a pipeline
	  such as `( cat /dev/zero ) | sleep 1' would never enter an EOF state.
	  Previously, the close-on-exec flag was being set for the descriptors
	  in question.  Of course, this did not work for the above and similar
	  cases.  So, the descriptors in question are now close()d explicitly.

	* Made some final changes to globbing to allow for more sensible
	  behavior WRT quoting.  The functions affected are: globargs(),
	  globchar(), and striparg().  Read and/or run `tests/glob_test.osh'
	  for details of the user-visible changes.  This script may cause
	  previous releases of the shell to dump core.

	  Basically, since striparg() had always been called *after* glob(3)
	  and since the path names generated by glob(3) cannot be trusted, it
	  ends up that the best course of action is to call striparg() *before*
	  glob(3).  This relatively simple change fixes a variety of *possible*
	  problems related to globbing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[osh-040731]:
osh.c:
	* Added bounds checking to striparg() to protect against a possible
	  buffer overflow.  Though this is unlikely to happen in the general
	  case, it is certainly *not* impossible.  This function had been
	  unprotected since at least osh-020214.

	* Added a new diagnostic, `Arg too long', to go with the
	  above-mentioned change.

	* Removed the `No directory' diagnostic from globargs().
	  It was simply not worth the trouble.  In compatible mode,
	  the `No match' diagnostic provides sufficient compatibility
	  in my opinion...

	* Changed the `chdir' command so that it only attempts to change to
	  the previous working directory when the `-' argument is *not* quoted.
	  This alows the shell to change to a directory by that name.
	  For example:
	  % mkdir -; chdir -; pwd; chdir \-; pwd; chdir -; pwd; rmdir -
	  chdir: no old directory
	  /home/jneitzel/osh_stuff/osh-040731
	  /home/jneitzel/osh_stuff/osh-040731/-
	  /home/jneitzel/osh_stuff/osh-040731

	  Remember that "-" or '-' has the same effect as the \- used above.
	  This is perhaps a little silly, but I figure if a directory *can*
	  exist then it should be possible to change to it.

	* Fixed the `<-' redirection argument so that it adheres to the
	  documentation.  This fixes a file descriptor leak in addition
	  to the incorrect behavior.  It should be silently ignored in
	  the following case: `echo hello | grep h <-'; now it is.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[osh-040723]:
osh.c:
	C: Fixed a small idiosyncrasy with the `No directory' and `No match'
	   diagnostics when running in compatible mode.  For example:
	   Before:
	   % if -d . -a -r . echo "`.' is a readable directory.";\
	     echo foo*; echo ?; echo []
	   `.' is a readable directory.
	   No match
	   No match
	   No directory

	   After:
	   % if -d . -a -r . echo "`.' is a readable directory.";\
	     echo foo*; echo ?; echo []
	   `.' is a readable directory.
	   No match
	   No match
	   No match

	   The shell should only print `No directory' when a directory
	   does not exist (ENOENT) or cannot be read (EACCES).  Yes, it is
	   expected that invalid patterns such as `[' and `[]' result in
	   the shell printing a `No match' diagnostic.

	* Changed the `<--' input redirection argument to `<-' instead.
	  This seems more consistent and will allow for possibly clearer
	  documentation in the future (if and when I add another feature
	  I've been thinking about).

fd2.[1c]:
	* Removed the fd2 utility and its manual page because of
	  possible licensing issues.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[osh-040718]:
	This release is made primarily to synchronize with the new branch
	of the shell which is named `sh6'.

osh.1:
	* More revisions and clarifications...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[osh-040714]:
Makefile:
	* Refined the description for _XOPEN_SOURCE a little.

osh.1:
	* General improvements...
	  This includes documenting some things that have never been very well
	  documented in this shell.

osh.c:
	C: Made changes to globbing which affect the shell in compatible mode.
	   This includes the addition of the `No directory' diagnostic which
	   was present in /etc/glob from Sixth Edition Unix.  Also, it looks
	   like I had previously misinterpreted exactly when the `No match'
	   diagnostic was supposed to be printed.  Now, when running in
	   compatible mode the shell really is compatible.  Yay =)

	* Added a `umask' special command.

	* Disallow SIGCHLD from being trapped.
	  When this signal is requested in a `trap' command, it is quietly
	  disallowed.  This is the same behavior seen with both SIGKILL and
	  SIGSTOP.  Thus, doing a `trap + 9 17 20' quietly has no effect.

	* Made changes to how the shell builds a command's argument vector.
	  Previously, malloc(3) was used.  Now, each command in the command
	  line is simply split into `\0'-terminated words.  Each argument is
	  actually a pointer to the corresponding word in the command line.

	  The changes to parameter substitution in osh-040628 made this
	  a perfectly sensible course of action.  This change also gives
	  a microscopic improvement in run-time performance (as judged
	  by time(1)).

	  The only remaining use of malloc(3) in the shell's execution stage
	  can be found in globargs().

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[osh-040628]:
	Thanks to Stephen M. Jones for suggesting that osh should be able
	to read a global rc file.  Thanks to Stephen C. VanDahm for assisting
	with some portability issues found in osh-040421.  Thanks also to
	Josep Portella Florit for reviewing osh-040421, making several useful
	suggestions, and sending patches.

	BTW, many changes were made to the manual pages.
	I hope they are clear, but I trust that if they are not then someone
	might be kind enough to tell me so and/or make suggestions.

	Some new files are included:
		examples/*:	initialization file examples
		  fd2.[1c]:	the fd2 utility

Makefile:
	* Added some notes about _XOPEN_SOURCE.

	* Added a target to optionally build and install fd2.

	* Removed the compile-time definition of `CLONE'.
	  This is now a run-time option which can be toggled in order to
	  enable or disable enhancements to the shell.

osh.c:
	C: Changed how the shell does parameter substitution.
	   This was the last major incompatibility w/ the Thompson shell.
	   Now, substitution is done *before* any command-line parsing
	   takes place.

	* Added the ability for login shells to read the initialization files
	  /etc/osh.login and/or $HOME/.osh.login if they exist.  A shell is
	  considered to be a login shell if its first argument starts w/ a
	  `-' character (e.g., -osh).

	* Added a `set' command to allow shell compatibility to be toggled
	  at run time.  In addition, the shell now checks for `OSH_COMPAT'
	  in the environment to tell future invocations of the shell which
	  mode the user wishes to run in.

	* In addition to the `set' command mentioned above, the following
	  special built-in commands have been added and are available when
	  the shell is in "noclone" mode:
		exec, setenv, trap, unsetenv

	* In globargs(), use `gl_pathc == 0' to detect an unmatched pattern
	  instead of checking if glob(3) returned `GLOB_NOMATCH'.  This allows
	  for those cases where glob(3) may not be POSIX-compliant.

	* Made osh command files that are run asynchronously ignore interrupts.
	  For example, `osh runcom&' should ignore SIGINT and SIGQUIT, and now
	  it does.

	* Reverted a so-called compatibility fix made in osh-040421.
	  Now, ignore SIGINT and SIGQUIT for asynchronous commands invoked
	  from a command file.  From a usability perspective, it is simply
	  too annoying to not do it this way.

	* Changed the `exit' command so that it always terminates a shell when
	  reading commands from a file.  Previously, it only terminated a shell
	  when invoked as `osh file'.  Note that `exit' still has no effect for
	  interactive shells or `osh -c command'; this is intentional as it is
	  compatible w/ the behavior of `exit' under the Thompson shell.

if.c:
	* Include <stdlib.h> for exit(3) so that Mac OS X doesn't complain.
	  In fact, <stdlib.h> should be included for exit(3) on all systems
	  as a simple matter of correctness.

	* Rename exp() to expr() to avoid conflicts w/ exp(3) on Mac OS X.
	  Strange, as <math.h> is not included there should not have been
	  any conflict.  Oh well, it is fixed now.

	* Enable this utility to return a meaningful exit status to the user.
	  In short, `if foo = foo' returns an exit status of 0; `if foo = bar'
	  returns an exit status of 1.  Previously, exit status was always 0.

	* Made the usage less ambiguous; corrected the documentation to reflect
	  the actual behavior.  In short, usage is (and always has been) as
	  follows:
		if expr [command [arg ...]]

	* Added some useful conditional primaries for constructing expressions.
	  See the manual pages for details.

	* Use the stdio(3) functions instead of write(2) for printing
	  the error messages.

	* In addition, added some useful diagnostic messages which were
	  inspired by the test(1) utility from Seventh Edition Unix.

goto.c:
	* Give an error message when standard input is not seekable.
	  Previously, a label not found error would be produced instead.

fd2.c:
	* A new utility and manual page...  It is an adaptation of the PWB/Unix
	  (roughly PWB/1.0 ?) redirect diagnostic output command.  The original
	  source came from the file `spencer_pwb.tar.gz' which can be found at:

		http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/PDP-11/Distributions/usdl/

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[osh-040421]:
osh*.1:
	* Made various changes to hopefully improve the clarity.
	  Added COMPATIBILITY, HISTORY, and NOTES sections.

osh.c:
	C: Made changes to how the shell handles terminating `\' characters
	   w/ the `-c' and `-t' flags.  This is a simple extension of the
	   same behavior exhibited when the shell is interactive or when it
	   executes a command file, the only difference being that where a
	   terminating `\' character causes the shell to read the next line
	   of input in an interactive shell or command file, w/ the `-c' and
	   `-t' flags the shell terminates w/o executing the command line.

	C: Allow parameter substitution w/ the `-c' and `-t' flags.  This
	   feature is not documented.  For example, invoking the shell as
	   follows allows parameter substitution to take place:
	   % osh -t one two three
	   echo $0 $1 $2 $3
	   -t one two three

	C: The shell now ignores SIGINT and SIGQUIT when the `-c' or `-t' flag
	   is used.  Thus, asynchronous commands invoked in this way ignore
	   interrupts as they should.

	C: Ignore SIGINT and SIGQUIT for all commands started from asynchronous
	   subshells.  For example, `( sleep 300; some_command ) >outfile&' now
	   ignores `^C' and `^\' as it should.

	C: Don't ignore SIGINT and SIGQUIT for asynchronous commands started
	   in command files.  If a command file is terminated by one of these
	   signals, the asynchronous commands should also terminate.

	* Reverted a change made to termination reporting in osh-040216 that
	  was not actually compatible w/ the V6 shell.

	* Always terminate the shell when read(2) fails.
	  This fixes a possible infinite loop.

	* Fixed a bug in the parser that caused syntactically incorrect
	  subshell commands not to be detected as such when preceded by
	  redirection arguments (e.g., `<infile >outfile ( | )').
	  This bug was introduced in osh-040216.

	* Fixed possible buffer overflows in substparm(); added a new error
	  message, "Too many characters", and made other changes necessary to
	  properly deal w/ the new error condition.  This problem had been
	  present since at least osh-020214.

	* Made some changes to how globbing is handled by the shell.
	  Specifically, glob(3) should only be called when an argument contains
	  unquoted occurrences of any of the glob characters `*', `?', or `['.
	  Previously, it was being called for every argument of an external
	  command.  This change improves run-time performance slightly as
	  judged by time(1) and information returned by getrusage(2).

	* The above-mentioned change also allows the following compatibility
	  feature.  Added globbing compatibility when the shell is compiled
	  w/ -DCLONE so that when no matches are found a diagnostic,
	  "No match", is printed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[osh-040216]:
Makefile:
	* Use 'PREFIX?=' to allow passing PREFIX to make from
	  the build environment.  This is a BSD extension, but
	  it appears that GNU make supports it as well.

	* Added a 'check' target to run a minimal test suite.

osh.c:
	* Security fix:
	  Always revoke set-id privileges.

	C: Redesigned and rewrote the parser.
	   Now, parsing and execution are completely separate.
	   This was the primary difference between the original implementation
	   by Ken Thompson and this one.  All remaining incompatibilities are
	   quite minor by comparison.

	C: Don't perform globbing on the argument given to 'chdir'.
	   It can be useful to glob in this case, but the V6 shell did not
	   do this.  So, this feature has been removed.

	C: Fixed the way that built-in commands are handled in pipelines.
	   Built-in commands do not participate as elements of a pipeline the
	   same way that external commands do.  They neither read input from,
	   nor write output to, a pipe.  Data passed down the pipeline is lost.
	   For example, `echo hello | chdir / | cat' still changes to /; it
	   simply does not say hello.  This same command line would have
	   previously caused a file descriptor leak.

	C: Allow redirection arguments to appear before the command.
	   Hence, the following examples are all identical to the shell:
	   % cat <infile >outfile
	   % <infile >outfile cat
	   % <infile cat >outfile

	C: Allow parameter substitution for redirection arguments
	   (e.g., 'command <$1', 'command >$1', and 'command >>$1').

	C: Fixed annoying behavior when user types EOF not at the beginning
	   of a line.  Doing so previously was effectively the same as hitting
	   'return' in that unread input before the EOF would be read, parsed,
	   and executed.  It now matches the behavior of the V6 shell (mostly)
	   and ignores the first EOF not at the beginning of a line.  Three
	   sequential EOFs (two in the V6 shell) will terminate the shell.
	   Of course, typing EOF once at the beginning of a line immediately
	   terminates the shell as it always has.

	C: Fixed incorrect handling of '\' at the end of an input line.
	   One or any other 'odd' number of '\' characters at the end of an
	   input line will continue the input onto the next line, while two or
	   any other 'even' number of '\' characters will not.

	* Fixed handling of command line overflow when shell is interactive.
	  The previous behavior could potentially be quite dangerous.  At the
	  least, it was very undesirable!  Now, when overflow happens only one
	  error message is printed, all unread data is flushed w/ tcflush(3),
	  and a new prompt is printed.  At this point, the shell will continue
	  w/ its normal read/parse/execute loop as if nothing had happened.

	* Fixed some problems w/ termination reporting of async processes.
	  For example, a `foo | bar | baz &' would mistaken try to report
	  termination status for all three commands.  Obviously, only the
	  last command should be reported.

	* When a child process of the shell or a command file receives the
	  SIGINT signal (e.g., user types '^C'), do not set termination status
	  to zero.  This matches the behavior of osh on V7, but it appears
	  the V6 shell may have not have done this..?  Non-zero termination
	  status is certainly more desirable in this case.

	* Fixed a file descriptor leak that happened when redirection failed.
	  For example, doing a `cat <infile >outfile' did not close 'infile'
	  when 'outfile' could not be created.

	* Fixed incorrect behavior of the 'shift' special built-in command.
	  '$0' was also being shifted.  Now, '$0' remains constant during the
	  life of a command file run.

	* Fixed some quoting abnormalities.  The behavior did not match the
	  V6 shell.  This was caused primarily because of calling glob(3) w/o
	  the GLOB_NOESCAPE flag.  So, a backslash was lost when globargs()
	  was called.  Also, I accidently broke nested quoting in a previous
	  release (e.g., '"word"' and/or "'word'").  All correct now! =)

	* Replaced the execv(3)/execvp(3) combo used when CLONE was defined
	  in the Makefile.  Simply use execvp(3) and document that the V6 shell
	  always used '.:/bin:/usr/bin', not PATH.  User can opt to set PATH
	  appropriately if more clone-like behavior is desired.

if.c:
	* Security fix:
	  Always revoke set-id privileges.

	* Replaced the execv(3)/execvp(3) combo used when CLONE was defined
	  in the Makefile.  Simply use execvp(3) and document it as described
	  above for osh.c.

goto.c:
	* Use strcmp(3) to compare strings instead of reimplementing
	  the same function internally.

	* Use the stdio(3) functions instead of write(2) for printing
	  the error messages.

	* Changed how 'label too long' errors are handled.
	  Now, when a label is encountered that happens to be too long
	  print the line number w/ the error message and terminate the
	  command file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[osh-031112]:
Makefile:
	* Added a test to ensure that destination directories exist.  If a
	  directory is missing, create it before trying to install the files.

osh.c:
	C: Reverted some previous changes to abnormal termination messages.
	   Specifically, the original on V6 used signal numbers instead of
	   the "Alarm clock" and "Terminated" messages.

	C: When printing termination reports for asynchronous commands
	   also print the process ID w/ the message.

	* Made changes/improvements to the detection of syntax errors for
	  malformed pipelines.  These syntax checks are done before actually
	  creating any pipes; otherwise, there would be file descriptor leakage
	  and possibly bad behavior when command lines have bad syntax.  This
	  is part one of a multipart fix.  The most critical parsing problems
	  are fixed now, but the problem of internal commands and pipelines
	  still needs attention.

	* Fixed a file descriptor leak caused when user hits, or would exceed,
	  the limit for maximum number of processes.

	* Added a missing newline to the 'Cannot pipe' error message.

	* Changed the prototype for xchdir() and made associated changes;
	  only pass args[1] to this function, not the entire argument vector.

	* Avoid possible difficulties caused when commands begin w/ blanks
	  (spaces, tabs) by stripping them away first.  This has the benefit
	  of simplifying some parts of the code, in addition to avoiding
	  needless function calls when command lines contains only blanks.

	* Added code to make command files terminate when any of the commands
	  cannot be executed, cannot be found, or terminate w/ a signal.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[osh-031014+]:
	The only noteworthy changes in this release are to the commentary
	in Makefile, NOTES, README, etc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[osh-031014]:
LICENSE:
	* Added additional license for code that I've written.

osh.c:
	* Added an additional copyright notice.

	* Changed a char *pointer to a const char *pointer since it is
	  only used for string constants.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[osh-031012]:
	A lot of the changes in this release are related to compatibility
	w/ the behavior of the original implementations from V6 and V7.
	In addition, the manual pages for "if" and "goto" have been changed
	to use man macros instead of escape sequences wherever possible
	as well as improving the appearance of the formatted output for
	the if(1) manual page.

osh.c:
	C: Write the prompt to stderr instead of stdout.

	C: Added an exit command to terminate command files.

	C: Make the 'login' command only work in interactive shells and
	   give an error message if not interactive.

	C: Changed the '>' and '>>' error message to 'cannot create'
	   instead of 'cannot open'.

	C: Make '>>' create the file if it does not already exist.

	C: Added a 'shift: no args' error message for the 'shift' command
	   when there is nothing to shift.

	C: Added "Hangup", "Alarm clock", and "Terminated" to the abnormal
	   termination messages that osh reports.  This matches osh on V7.

	C: Added code to properly report the abnormal termination status of
	   asynchronous commands (&) upon receipt of the next command.  This
	   was documented in the V6 sh(1) manual page.

	* Fixed a problem where terminated children (zombies) could get in the
	  way and render the shell unusable when the user reached hard or soft
	  process limit.  The shell's 'wait' command was, and still is, an
	  effective way to exorcise these zombies.  Although, this should
	  be less necessary now that the above feature is implemented.

	* Avoid an infinite loop and give an error when the shell loses its
	  input.  An easy way to reproduce this is to close standard input
	  from another shell w/ redirection.

	* Merged in code I use that makes 'chdir' more like 'cd' in modern
	  shells by allowing 'chdir' to HOME, 'chdir -' to previous, and
	  'chdir dir' to any other directory.  You can always define CLONE
	  in the Makefile to compile w/ the original behavior if you wish.

	* Ignore '#!' at the beginning of command files.  This is just for
	  convenience.  The original did not do this, but it makes sense since
	  this implementation differs from the original by not taking any extra
	  steps to feed executable text files to osh directly.  Let the kernel
	  do this for us.

if.c:
	C: Added an exit command.

	* Added a 'cannot fork' error message.

	* Error messages are now written to stderr, not stdout.

	* Changed the '-r' and '-w' tests to use access(2) instead of open(2).
	  This makes the '-w' test give correct results for directories where
	  it previously failed to do so.

	* Match the documentation and give an error when the command in
	  '{ command }' is another 'if'.

	* Temporarily removed the '-c' primitive from the code since it
	  is undocumented and does not appear to do anything useful.

goto.c:
	* Fixed a buffer overflow caused when the label was too long.
	  It looks like this bug has been there since goto was written
	  back in the 1970s.  Also, reduced the maximum size of the buffer
	  to 128 characters instead of LINE_MAX characters.

	* Added a 'label too long' error message to go w/ the above fix.

	* Error messages are now written to stderr, not stdout.

	* Replaced all of the gotos w/ while loops for the sake of clarity.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[osh-030811]:
osh.c:
	* Fixed bug introduced in previous release by declaring array
	  w/ incorrect size.  This array is now dynamically allocated.

if.c:
	* Added code to check and enforce maximum number of arguments.

goto.c:
	* Completely fixed detection of EOF in command files.
	  The reason for these EOF problems was because getchar(3) in
	  V6 Unix indicated end-of-file w/ '\0', and of course this
	  is no longer the case today.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[osh-030730]:
	* This is the initial maintenance release by Jeffrey Allen Neitzel.

osh.c:
	* Added '#ifdef CLONE' so the desired command search behavior
	  can be chosen at build time.

	* Fixed segfault when command line contains only whitespace.
	  We simply ignore this situation now.

	* Fixed segfault when redirections are used w/o a command.
	  This will now result in a syntax error.

	* Fixed segfault when redirecting a command w/o a filename.
	  This will now result in a syntax error.

	* Fixed a small memory leak when using redirection arguments.

	* Made osh correctly detect when a command line contains
	  too many arguments.  This allows command lines to have a
	  maximum of 255 arguments.

if.c:
	* Added '#ifdef CLONE' to make if(1) search for external commands
	  the same way osh(1) does.

goto.c:
	* Fixed a bug where goto should produce a 'label not found' error
	  but would instead go into an infinite loop at the end of the
	  command file.  We now correctly detect EOF and successfully
	  report 'label not found' errors.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[osh-020214]:
	* All releases of osh prior to and including 020214 were authored
	  and maintained by Gunnar Ritter.
